Freak me like you want to, girl
I don't give a damn about the bees and birds
You can get fat like the Venus in France
Hop up on my Echelon down on girls
I be getting down onto you
For I just want no models, not the way she swerve
You don't have '
Swerving with my arms, listen up on me

She came for my head like Marie Antoinette
I told her calm down, eat cake instead
Surprise, surprise, I got his frills all wet
Now he wanna act like a bad gal, bet
Bashful like tuna
Turn up, I turned up
Wrapped him like cashmere, soft like pashmina
I'm Martin Anjuna, sniffed out that aura
Getting new ideas and I put that work on her
I tap your soul up, I like that new ' taboo
I row you like that old canoe
I put that hole in you and think of planting so we grow in you
Let these flowers bloom up in your bones, up in your home and room
And treat you like the emperor of Rome, do like the romans do
I'll freak you like a naked black queen on her throne
Oils and lotions, too
I got the swagger of Atlas, put the whole world on my back
This mattress is Atlantis

Freak me like you want to, girl
I don't give a damn about the bees and birds
You can get fat like the Venus in France
Hop up on my Echelon down on girls
I be getting down onto you
For I just want no models, not the way she swerve
You don't have '
Swerving with my arms, listen up on me

Is that the Star of David? When can I see you naked?
Pick your fruit for this ' watch me bake it
Blueberry, apricot, yummy, hot, and tasty
Sorry, oops, I laced it, now we getting baked
Catch me in the cut, coughing up a rare rag muffin
Our bluffing just blushing the blunts in
Doing it dirty like dozens busting the scene
And the buttocks getting loose with the love
And know he be 'when it comes to pushing a shuttle
I'mma reel that bitch over here, yo
Hella key, it resembles the scene like the champion
One that is hero, if you fail me ain't gonna be no free throws
Young and yellow, never asked for coco
Easily heavy shut down like popo, locked and loco
How come I see the logo, she was beautiful yet'
I try to ' I'm showing him romantics, he's feeling that, it's gigantic
So caught up in the mix, got him sinking like Titanic
So far, blow it up'

Freak me like you want to, girl
I don't give a damn about the bees and birds
You can get fat like the Venus in France
Hop up on my Echelon down on girls
I be getting down onto you
For I just want no models, not the way she swerve
You don't have '
Swerving with my arms, listen up on me
