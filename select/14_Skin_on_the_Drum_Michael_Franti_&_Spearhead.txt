I'm a little under the weather today
Too much of pepper spray can make a brother congested
You know what I'm saying
But the harder they hit us the louder we become
Kinda like the skin on the drum, you what I'm saying?
I was born botanical, the soul of an animal
Deep beneath the layers, I sink my roots
No need for mechanical, I come strictly organical
When I need to feast, I look to the East
That's why I'm never scared of the beast
Even though they try to prey upon me
I'm protected by the one always greater than me
So now I reveal to thee because you wanna see
The contour of my mystery, the strength of my arches
The color of my conscience and the way that I process my diction
Some fact, some fiction, some mystery and some future fantasy
I'm the trunk that holds the branches
The leaves who do the dances
My flowers romantic, my love gigantic
From Africa, transplanted to transatlantic
In the heat of the sun, I bring shade for everyone
Like the beat on the one, I'm the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
See I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
Fire one, fire two, fire one, fire two, fire one, fire two
See I've been fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
See I'm beginning to perspire from deep within to the skin
Yo, the feminine and the masculine
The pieces of the puzzle, see me reflections in the puddle
After the storm the purple of the sky brings to mind another time
When we resided below the water line, life was fine there human divine
But in the years following, evil men came swallowing everything in sight
Some learned to run, some stayed to fight
I knelled at the tomb of the soldier, said I would love to behold her
The magic in store there, she touched me on the shoulder
She said, "In time all is revealed, box of light be unsealed
Now listen to me son, be like the skin on the drum"
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I keep on living with the fullness of the one
Like the heat of the sun or the skin on the drum
I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
See, I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
See I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
See, I'm fully marinated and now I'm ready for the fire
So you can fire one, fire one, fire two
Fire one, fire two, fire one, fire two
And as the pepper gas clears and police and protesters go home
Just as the morning dew are tear drops of the night
My emotions are always there for you and will never leave you dry
Bless
