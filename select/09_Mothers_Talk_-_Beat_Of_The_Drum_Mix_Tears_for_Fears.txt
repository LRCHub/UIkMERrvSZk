We can work it out

(Here in New York, here in New York, here in New York City)
(Here in New York, here in New York, here in New York City)
(Here in New York, here in New York, here in New York City)

The beat of the drum
The beat of the drum
The beat of the drum

(There's a second)
(For forty years our people lived with hope, now there's no hope)
(There's nothing we face that he cannot handle)

Put your head right
Put your head right
Put your head right
Put your head right
Put-put your head right
Put your head right
Put-put-put-put-put-put-put-put-put your head right
Put your head right next to my heart
Fear of the...
Put-put-put-put

(There's a second)
(Here in New York, here in New York, here in New York City)
(Here in New York City)

The beat, the beat, the beat
The-the-the-the-the-the-the beat of
The beat, the beat, the-the-the beat
The-the-the beat

My features form with a change in the weather
We can
We can work it out
My features form with a change in the weather
Better late than never, there's a change in the weather
We can work it out
When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows

When the wind blows
When the wind blows
When the mothers talk
When the mothers talk
When the wind blows
We can
Only we can work it out
